# Voice-Chat-With-Research-Paper
This repo contains python code that was created via Databutton, Cohere, OpenAI and Streamlit. It is a multi-lingual chatbot that reads your text or PDF files, and is prompt-engineered specifically for medical data.
The app alows you to pass voice input, which then gets transcribet to text via OpenAI's Whisper. That text gets passed into a prompt using LangChain and finally, the prompt is fed into an LLM by Cohere.
